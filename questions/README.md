# Module 1 Open Response

You will need to set up a development environment for the course. Please complete the set up prior to the first live session.

## Clojure Editors

There are a wide range of editors that can be used for Clojure, including:

  1. Emacs / Cider (Cider https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider or Prelude https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)
  2. Atom / Chlorine 
  3. Visual Studio Code / Calva
  4. Vim / Fireplace
  5. IntelliJ / Cursive (__Prefer this one unless you already use Emacs__)
  
The most capable editor is probably Emacs / Cider or IntelliJ / Cursive. However, Emacs has a steep learning
curve and is only recommended if you are willing to dedicate yourself to the significant additional work required
to master it. IntelliJ / Cursive can be obtained for free if you use it for non-commercial use. 

__For the class, I recommend using IntelliJ / Cursive.__ 

## Setting Up IntelliJ / Cursive

Follow the instructions here: https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/index.html

## Setting up Emacs 

I recommend using Prelude, which is a preconfigured version of Emacs: 

https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude

Prelude should automatically include Cider:

## Testing Your Dev Environment

Clone the open response questions repository here:

https://github.com/vu-cs6385-su20/open-response-questions

Follow the instructions for "Connecting the Code to IntelliJ Cursive via the REPL". There is a note to "not attempt this assignment until after the first live session". This note refers to creating the questions / coding challenges. You SHOULD complete the steps below.

Complete the following steps and paste the answers to them into the open response form in 2VU:

  1. What gets printed in the REPL when you start it? Include all of the messages that print out.
  2. What gets printed in the REPL when you go to Tools->REPL->Load File? 
  3. What is your keyboard shortcut to load files into the REPL? 
  4. What is your keyboard shortcut to sync files with the REPL?
  5. What gets printed if you send the "-main" function in src/questions/core.clj to the REPL?
  6. Provide the solution to the count-words function in src/questions/week0.clj
