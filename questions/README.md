# Module 1 Open Response

You will need to set up a development environment for the course. Please complete the set up prior to the first live session.

## Assumptions

This guide assumes that you have a Java SDK installed. Any JDK version >= 8.0 should be fine.

## Install Leiningen

Install Leiningen using the instructions here: https://leiningen.org/

## Install a Clojure Editor

There are a wide range of editors that can be used for Clojure, including:

  1. Emacs / Cider (Cider https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider or Prelude https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)
  2. Atom / Chlorine 
  3. Visual Studio Code / Calva
  4. Vim / Fireplace
  5. IntelliJ / Cursive (__Prefer this one unless you already use Emacs__)
  
The most capable editor is probably Emacs / Cider or IntelliJ / Cursive. However, Emacs has a steep learning
curve and is only recommended if you are willing to dedicate yourself to the significant additional work required
to master it. IntelliJ / Cursive can be obtained for free if you use it for non-commercial use. 

__For the class, I recommend using IntelliJ / Cursive.__ 

## Setting Up IntelliJ / Cursive

Follow the instructions here: https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/index.html

## Setting up Emacs 

I recommend using Prelude, which is a preconfigured version of Emacs: 

https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude

Prelude should automatically include Cider:

https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider

## Testing Your Dev Environment

Clone the open response questions repository here:

https://github.com/vu-cs6385-su20/open-response-questions

Follow the instructions for "Connecting the Code to IntelliJ Cursive via the REPL". There is a note to "not attempt this assignment until after the first live session". This note refers to creating the questions / coding challenges. You SHOULD complete the steps below.

Complete the following steps and paste the answers to them into the open response form in 2VU:

  1. What gets printed in the REPL when you start it? Include all of the messages that print out.
  2. What gets printed in the REPL when you go to Tools->REPL->Load File? 
  3. What is your keyboard shortcut to load files into the REPL? 
  4. What is your keyboard shortcut to sync files with the REPL?
  5. What gets printed if you send the "-main" function in src/questions/core.clj to the REPL?
  6. Provide the solution to the count-words function in src/questions/week0.clj

# Module 2 Open Response

Create your questions and write a coding challenge that requires creating at least three named functions, one of which is a higher-order function, and submit them as described in the first live session. Your questions should be based on the current module and the coding challenges should be based on the material from Module 1.

https://github.com/vu-cs6385-su20/open-response-questions/blob/master/README.md

# Module 3 Open Response

Create your questions and a coding challenge that requires writing a simple application with multiple functions that uses maps and lists with destructuring. Your questions should be based on the current module and the coding challenges should be based on the material from Module 2.

https://github.com/vu-cs6385-su20/open-response-questions/blob/master/README.md

# Module 4 Open Response

Create your questions based on the lecture material as usual.

Resolve any outstanding issues in your Module 2-3 coding challenges.

In addition to your questions, please:

1. Create a new branch named "your_name_solutions_moduleN" (e.g., jules_white_solutions_module1). 
   ```
   git checkout -b your_name_solutions_moduleN
   ```

2. In this new branch, solve six of the coding challenges from Module 1. Do not solve your own challenges.

3. When you are done, push your branch to the repository. 
   ```
   git push -u origin your_name_solutions_moduleN
   ```

4. Create a pull request from your branch. The "base" branch should be "master" and the "compare" branch should be the branch that you created for your solutions. Do not assign the pull request or list a reviewer. A sample pull request has been created here: https://github.com/vu-cs6385-su20/open-response-questions/pull/13
   
5. If you want to solve a challenge, but you feel that the specification isn't clear, please post a courteous issue   requesting clarification from the creator of the challenge. Make sure and assign the issue to the creator of the challenge. However, you should prioritize finishing your six challenges over getting a response from the person that created the challenge you request additional information about. 

6. Of course, you could peek at the solutions, but then you would be wasting your time in the course. Also, you will need this practice to gain the skills needed to succeed in the later assignments.

In the open response form, post a link to your pull request as the solution.
